           <p>Pompeii was an ancient Roman city located in the modern comune of Pompei 
            near Naples in the Campania region of Italy. Pompeii, along with Herculaneum 
            and many villas in the surrounding area (e.g. at Boscoreale, Stabiae), was buried 
            under 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.

            </testing>Largely preserved under the ash, the excavated city offers a unique snapshot of Roman life, frozen
             at the moment it was buried and providing an extraordinarily detailed insight into the everyday 
             life of its inhabitants. It was a wealthy town, enjoying many fine public buildings and luxurious 
             private houses with lavish decorations, furnishings and works of art which were the main attractions 
             for the early excavators. Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, were entombed
              in the ash and decayed leaving voids which archaeologists found could be used as moulds to make plaster
               casts of unique and often gruesome figures in their final moments of life. The numerous graffiti carved
                on the walls and inside rooms provide a wealth of examples of the largely lost Vulgar Latin spoken 
                colloquially at the time, contrasting with the formal language of the classical writers.
